ffmpeg output:
- For reading metadata, ffprobe can emit to json
- For progress reporting, ffmpeg has flags that allow changing the pipe or sending to a file if needed
- For error handling, ffmpeg has stricter/looser options available (e.g., xerror)
- We can detect file format & stream format by looking at format_name / codec_name / profile in ffprobe output, with "-show_format -show_streams"
