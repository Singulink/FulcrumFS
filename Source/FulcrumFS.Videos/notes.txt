TODO: need to validate that adding [field: AllowNull] is enough to satisfy Signulink's RuntimeNullable lib - one alternative could be to instead mark as nullable but add [DisallowNull] and [NotNull]; or to also add [MaybeNull] to the field

Progress reporting:
- Ensure we test that ffmpeg doesn't delete my temp file & re-create it on Windows when printing output into it, but rather is able to just append into it immediately
- Ensure that the permissions / share is correct for our usage on both Windows & Unix

Metadata not successfully preserved (I tested on a video from my phone):
- A lot of metadata was missing, such as "Play Mode", "Author", "Samsung Model", "Android Version", "Android Capture FPS", "Samsung Android Utc Offset"
- A lot of metadata was added, such as "Buffer Size", "Max Bitrate", "Average Bitrate", "Media Language Code", "Handler Vendor ID", "Encoder"
- Some was even changed, such as "Handler Type"
- This only covers "metadata" metadata, not other kinds like chapters, etc.
