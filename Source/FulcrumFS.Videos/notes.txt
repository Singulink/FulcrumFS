TODO: need to validate that adding [field: AllowNull] is enough to satisfy Singulink's RuntimeNullable lib - one alternative could be to instead mark as nullable but add [DisallowNull] and [NotNull]; or to also add [MaybeNull] to the field

Progress reporting:
- Ensure we test that ffmpeg doesn't delete my temp file & re-create it on Windows when printing output into it, but rather is able to just append into it immediately
- Ensure that the permissions / share is correct for our usage on both Windows & Unix

Metadata not successfully preserved (I tested on a video from my phone):
- A lot of metadata was missing, such as "Play Mode", "Author", "Samsung Model"
- A lot of metadata was added, such as "Buffer Size", "Max Bitrate", "Average Bitrate", "Media Language Code", "Encoder"
- Some was even changed, such as "Handler Type", "Android Capture FPS"
- Some other flags were also changed: "Major Brand", "Compatible Brands", but these seem more expected.
- This only covers "metadata" metadata, not other kinds like chapters, etc.

Note: we require libx264 / libx265, libfdk_aac / aac, mp4 muxing, and zscale filter in the ffmpeg build at a minimum.
