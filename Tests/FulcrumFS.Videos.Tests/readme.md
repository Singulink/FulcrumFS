Note: you can create a `ffmpeg_path.txt` file like so for testing locally without having to set the environment variable manually (which also allows testing in VS Code for example - note leading / trailing whitespace is ignored) - place it in this directory:
```
/opt/homebrew/bin
```

See the `readme.md` in `Videos` folder for the licensing information for some of the files in there that are under a different license.
